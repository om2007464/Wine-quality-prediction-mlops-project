## üç∑ Wine Quality Prediction - MLOps Project

### Overview

This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties and features, such as acidity, alcohol content, pH, and more. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict wine quality based on these features, which can be useful for wine manufacturers and researchers to improve quality control.

The project is designed with an **MLOps** approach to ensure smooth deployment, model monitoring, and continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). It uses a variety of tools and technologies to manage the entire machine learning lifecycle, from data preprocessing to model deployment and monitoring in production.

### Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**: The dataset is cleaned and transformed to create meaningful features for the machine learning model.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Several machine learning algorithms, such as XGBoost, are used to train the model, and its performance is evaluated using various metrics.
- **Model Deployment**: The trained model is deployed using Flask, where users can input wine features and get predictions on wine quality.
- **MLOps Workflow**: The project integrates tools like Prefect, Kubeflow, and GitHub Actions to automate workflows, track experiments, and monitor models in production.
- **Model Monitoring**: The performance of the deployed model is continuously monitored using tools like Evidently AI and WhyLabs to detect any potential issues like model drift.

## üìä Dataset and Features

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Wine Quality Dataset**, which contains samples of red wine and includes various physicochemical properties of the wines. The goal of this dataset is to predict the quality of wine based on these features.

The dataset is publicly available on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality).

- **Number of Samples**: 1599 (Red wines)
- **Number of Features**: 12
- **Target Variable**: `quality` (Wine quality, rated from 0 to 10)

### Features

The dataset contains the following **features**:

1. **Fixed Acidity**: Acid content in wine, measured as grams of tartaric acid per liter.
2. **Volatile Acidity**: The amount of acetic acid in wine, expressed in grams per liter. Higher levels indicate vinegar-like characteristics.
3. **Citric Acid**: Provides a fresh, fruity taste, measured in grams per liter.
4. **Residual Sugar**: The amount of sugar remaining in the wine after fermentation, measured in grams per liter.
5. **Chlorides**: The salt content in wine, measured in grams per liter.
6. **Free Sulfur Dioxide**: The amount of free sulfur dioxide in wine, which helps preserve the wine, measured in milligrams per liter.
7. **Total Sulfur Dioxide**: The total amount of sulfur dioxide in the wine, both free and bound, measured in milligrams per liter.
8. **Density**: The density of the wine, which is related to alcohol content and sugar levels.
9. **pH**: The acidity or alkalinity of the wine, measured on a scale from 0 to 14.
10. **Sulphates**: The level of sulphates in wine, which act as preservatives and antioxidants.
11. **Alcohol**: The alcohol content of the wine, measured as a percentage.
12. **Quality**: The target variable, indicating the quality of the wine, rated on a scale from 0 to 10. This is the variable that the model predicts.

### Data Preprocessing

In this project, data preprocessing steps like missing value handling, normalization, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables (if needed) are applied to prepare the data for model training. The features are carefully selected to ensure the best predictive performance for wine quality prediction.
